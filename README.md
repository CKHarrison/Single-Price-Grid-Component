## Overview
This is my first frontend master's challenge that I have attempted. I had a great time working on this project. It has helped solidify my flexbox and mobile first design skills. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process
My first step in designing this page was to layout the HTML content in accordance to the desktop specifications, I find that it's easier to reason about the content that way. Then I layout the typography and general body styling of the page. I then moved on to designing the mobile layout first, and then finally add in media queries to make the layout match the wider screen specifications.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tips and Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was useful to lookup properties that I couldn't remember like flex grow.
